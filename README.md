## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

My challenge was to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques I picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

### Getting started

1. Open index.html in your browser to open the website.

Optimizations Made:
####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html
1) I optimized index.html to remove all Critical Rendering Path errors as revealed by analyzing the site via Google PageSpeed Insights and Chrome Development Tools.

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html
1) I optimized views/pizza.html, by modifying views/js/main.js until my frames per second rate was 60 fps or higher.
